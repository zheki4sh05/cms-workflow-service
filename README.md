## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project architecture

Target architecture for Workflow Service (incidents, investigations, action plans, case lifecycle):

- [Architecture blueprint](./docs/architecture.md)

## Statuses

### Incident statuses

- `OPEN` - incident is created and waiting for processing.
- `PARTLY_PROGRESS` - at least one related case is still at assignment stage while others may already be in work.
- `IN_PROGRESS` - related active cases are in investigation/workflow process.
- `RESOLVED` - incident is resolved.

When incident transitions to `RESOLVED`, the `incident.resolved_date` column is set to transition timestamp.

### Case statuses

- `ASSIGNED` - case is assigned to a responsible user.
- `OPEN` - case is open.
- `INVESTIGATING` - investigation is in progress.
- `ACTION_PLAN` - action plan stage.
- `WAITING_VERIFICATION` - action plan submitted and waiting for verification.
- `ACTION_IN_PROGRESS` - verified action plan is being executed.
- `REJECTED` - case is rejected.
- `CLOSED` - case is completed and closed.

`IN_PROGRESS` is used only for `incident`, not for `case`.

### Action plan task statuses

- `TODO` - task is created and waiting to be started.
- `IN_PROGRESS` - task is in progress.
- `DONE` - task is completed.

## Kafka incident intake and outbox

- Consumer subscribes to Kafka topic `incident_topic` via Nest microservice transport.
- Incoming messages are normalized and saved into outbox with status `pending`.
- Scheduler (`@nestjs/schedule`) polls pending outbox messages for processing of `incident_topic.received`.
- Polling interval is configurable via `OUTBOX_RESOLVER_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.

Environment variables:

- `KAFKA_BROKERS` (default: `localhost:9092`)
- `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` (default: `cms-workflow-service`)
- `KAFKA_GROUP_ID` (default: `cms-workflow-service-consumer-group`)
- `DB_HOST` (default: `localhost`)
- `DB_PORT` (default: `5432`)
- `DB_USER` (default: `postgres`)
- `DB_PASSWORD` (default: `postgres`)
- `DB_NAME` (default: `cms_workflow`)
- `DB_SYNCHRONIZE` (default: `false`, set `true` only for local development)
- `OUTBOX_RESOLVER_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default: `1`, set `10` to run every 10 minutes)
- `MINIO_ENDPOINT` (default: `localhost`)
- `MINIO_PORT` (default: `9000`)
- `MINIO_USE_SSL` (default: `false`)
- `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` (default: `minioadmin`)
- `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` (default: `minioadmin`)
- `MINIO_BUCKET` (default: `cms-workflow-attachments`)

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

docker compose -f docker-compose.minio.yml up -d
```

MinIO endpoints:

- S3 API: `http://localhost:9000`
- Console: `http://localhost:9001`

## Run tests

```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
